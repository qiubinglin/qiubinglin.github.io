## Control unit
The control unit is a component of CPU that directs the operation of the processor.

## Instruction pointer
The instruction pointer specifies the location in memory containing the next instruction to be executed by the CPU.

## Register
Providing direct access to instructions and data for CPU core.

## Arithmetic logic unit(ALU)
The arithmetic logic unit is a digital circuit within the processor that performs integer arithmetic and bitwise logic operation.

## Floating point unit(FPU)
The floating point unit is designed to handle operations on floating point numbers.

## Address generation unit(AGU)
The address generation unit is for calculating addresses used by CPU to access main memory.

## Memory management unit (MMU)
Translating logical addresses into physical RAM addresses.

## Cache
A CPU cache is a hardware cache used by CPU to reduce the average cost to access data from the main memory.

Tipically, A CPU has L1, L2 and L3 cache.
